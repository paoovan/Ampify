# Project 1
Problem Statement Chosen ïƒ  AMPIFY
Placements this year have been a strenuous task. Kashyap , Chitranshu and Anshul took the responsibility of getting the entire batch placed. The work in TPO and a broken music system has made their life too stressful. Now it's your responsibility to keep them entertained with a music player while they keep doing their work.
So to sort out this problem we are preparing a music player.
